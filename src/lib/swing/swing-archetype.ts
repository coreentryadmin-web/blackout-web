// src/lib/swing/swing-archetype.ts — the archetype-specific PILLAR WEIGHT tables (FM#7).
//
// The swing evidence score is 7 pillars, but the WEIGHTS differ by archetype: a breakout is judged mostly
// on structure + relative strength; a flow-accumulation on flow persistence + strike concentration; a
// post-earnings/event on the catalyst response. Sharing one weight vector across archetypes would blur
// fundamentally different trades into one bucket (failure mode #7). Each archetype's vector sums to 100.
//
// CALIBRATION-FIRST: these weights are a DESIGNED PRIOR, not a graduated edge. SWING_PILLAR_WEIGHTS_GRADUATED
// is false — a weight vector only becomes "earned" once its archetype's graded bucket clears the ladder
// (calibration.ts). Until then the score is evidence surfaced on the desk, sizing/gating nothing.
