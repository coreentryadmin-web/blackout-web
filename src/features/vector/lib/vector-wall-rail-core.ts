 * Pure colour / size / identity helpers for the Vector bead rail.

 * the primitive implements lightweight-charts' `ISeriesPrimitive` and only runs with a live chart
 * and a canvas context, so none of it can be exercised under `tsx --test`. These four functions
 * decide how big a bead is, how opaque, and whether two frames are talking about the SAME bead —
 * i.e. everything about the rail that can be wrong without throwing.
 *
 * The bead MAGNITUDE ladder (relStrengthT / beadRadiusForNotional / pctToNotionalProxy) lives in
 * vector-wall-visual.ts and is already covered there; this file composes it, it does not restate it.

 * scalar per strike: the primitive picked the strike whose LATEST bucket held the highest share and
 * emphasised that strike's ENTIRE trail. So the crown was painted retroactively across the whole
 * session onto whoever held it at that instant, and stripped retroactively from whoever had lost it.
 * There was no moment on the chart where a king was seen losing it or a challenger taking it — the
 * rail is a historical record, but kingship was rendered as a present-tense property.
 *
 * It is not a cosmetic loss. Measured across the recorded rails for one session (2026-08-07,
 * weekly): every name handed the crown over repeatedly — TSLA 16 handovers, NVDA 57, SPY 64, QQQ 48
 * — and the king's own share swung enormously within the day (TSLA 21%→62%, AAPL 25%→79%). On TSLA
 * the eventual king spent part of the morning near 10% share and still rendered crowned there.
 *
 * The data needed to fix it was already present: every bucket carries each strike's `pct`, so the
 * king at time T is simply the highest-pct strike among the trails at T. No new plumbing.
 *
 * Ties keep the FIRST strike encountered rather than flickering between equals — a tie means two
 * walls are equally dominant, and picking deterministically is better than alternating each repaint.
